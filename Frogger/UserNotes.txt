Hello!

You have the just got a fresh copy of our Frogger game!
Now we do have some warnings and some instructions to allow this
code to work properly, put the mp3 files and the common folder in the same folder as the
html and js file so that they will be in one workspace or folder. so all files can be in one folder
do not take out the js files out of the common folder!
